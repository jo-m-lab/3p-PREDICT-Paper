# Making Standardized names

The code these subfolders shows how we mapped between our original manual annotations,
and our datadriven naming system as shown in

* `0_R-within_celltype_1vsRest_diffexp.ipynb`
* `1_R-score_diffexp_make_standardnames.ipynb`

To replicate our standardized naming system those two notebooks are all that are essential

For extra (and updated) help with managing the endclust folder and mapping standardized names to cells, we recommend looking at the [ARBOL tutorial](https://shaleklab.github.io/SCTieredClustering/)
